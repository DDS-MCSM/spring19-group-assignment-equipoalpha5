## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
m <- GroupAssignmentPackage::getIpGeolocated()
m

```



```{r countDomains}
domains <- GroupAssignmentPackage::getCountDomains()
summary(domains)
```



```{r countTargets}
targets <- GroupAssignmentPackage::getCountTarget()
summary(targets)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
